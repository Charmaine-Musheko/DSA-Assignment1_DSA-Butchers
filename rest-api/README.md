# RESTful API Asset Management Skeleton

This package contains the starter files for **Question 1** of the assignment.
Each member has a dedicated module:

- `patema.bal` – service definition and database setup
- 'db.bal contains database setup, asset_service.bal contains asset add/get, Ballerina.toml & main.bal were neccessary to test, ' 
- `ghost.bal` – list and filter assets
- `ngozu.bal` – overdue asset checks
- `treasure.bal` – component and schedule management
- `charmaine_client.bal` – sample client to interact with the service

Use `bal run` (once Ballerina is installed) to start the service or execute the
client.
